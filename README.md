# Captcha
A recreation of the Google Captcha test.

The image is split up into a 3x3 grid, then added into the captcha test.

## ⚠️ warning
The code in this is very messy. I just wanted to get everything to work. Parts of code are repeated, and I'm attempting to make an api from a static hosted website. Don't copy the code because its really bad. I will possible tidy it up in the future.

## How to use the website
You can open the website using [this](https://maximilianmcc.github.io/Captcha/) link.
